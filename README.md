# ism2411-data-cleaning-copilot
# short project description

This project was built as a program that would clean and organize a messy sales data set. It used a downloaded raw data file and used code to make the data consistent and readable. 

The project was built for ISM2411 at University of South Florida to portray understanding of python, github, copilot, and visual studio code. 

The resulted format should be the data lowercase, stripped, spaces replaced with underscores, numeric values, and removed incorrect data.
